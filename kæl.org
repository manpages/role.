 - Obscuring mist:
   A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The
   vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A
   creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss
   chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss
   chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
   A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell,
   disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses
   the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell
   burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A wall
   of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

 - Spider climb: 
   The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces
   or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected
   creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The
   subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it need not
   make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface
   (even upside down). A spider climbing creature retains its
   Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and
   opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It
   cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
   Target: willing target
   Range: touch

**** Wrath of nature (···)

  - Sleet Storm
  Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]
  Level: 	Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
  Components: 	V, S, M/DF
  Casting Time: 1 standard action
  Range: 	Long (400 ft. + 80 ft./level)
  Area: 	Cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)
  Duration: 	1 round/level
  Clash:        None

  Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes
  the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or
  through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance
  check. Failure means it can’t move in that round, while failure by 5
  or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).  The sleet
  extinguishes torches and small fires.

  - Call Lightning
    Evocation [Electricity]
    Level: 	Drd 3
    Components: 	V, S
    Casting Time: 	1 round
    Range: 	Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
    Effect: 	One or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning
    Duration: 	1 min./level
    Clash: Druidism vs physical

    Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round
    thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long,
    vertical bolt of lightning that deals electricity damage. The bolt
    of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target
    point you choose within the spell’s range (measured from your
    position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the
    path of the bolt is affected.  You need not call a bolt of
    lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be
    performed. However, each round after the first you may use a
    standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You
    may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level
    (maximum 10 bolts).  If you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a
    rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a
    tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air
    elemental of at least Large size)—each bolt deals gets r1 (replace
    one roll with a success). This spell functions indoors or
    underground but not underwater.

     Remove Disease and Neutralize Poison.

**** Advanced Animalism (···)
     
     Magic Fang: willing animal's natural attacks deal extra point of damage.
     
     Dominate Animal
     Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
     Level: 	Animal 3, Drd 3
     Components: 	V, S
     Casting Time: 	1 round
     Range: 	Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
     Target: 	One animal
     Duration: 	6 sec/level
     Clash:     Druidism vs Mental
     
     You can enchant an animal and direct it with simple commands such
     as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.” Suicidal or self-destructive
     commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more
     size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply
     ignored.
     
     Dominate animal establishes a mental link between you and the
     subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental
     command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the
     creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input
     from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because
     you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may
     be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own
     comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on
     controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do
     something it normally couldn’t do. Changing your instructions or
     giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of
     redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

**** Freedom (····)

     Air Walk: Subject treads on air as if solid (climb at 45-degree angle).
     Duration: 6 sec/level
     Range: willing creature touched

     Freedom of Movement: Subject moves normally despite impediments.
     Duration: 6 sec/level
     Range: willing creature touched

**** Advanced life magic (····)
     Heal: same as cure wounds, except it removes ability damage inflicted by
     poisons and diseases. Note that it doesn't remove poison nor a disease.

     Summon Nature's Manifestation: summons a 4/2 magical beast.

**** Venom immunity (····)
     Mages of nature eventually become immune to all poisons (but not diseases)

**** Trackless step (····)
     Mages of nature don't interfere with natural surroundings.  You
     may choose not to leave a trace while wandering through natural
     environments.

** Arcanism 4 (2+2 | XP: 3+4)
=>
Arcane: 4

**** Prepared (·)
     
**** Basic illusion (··)

Ghost sound:

Casting Time: 	1 standard action
Range: 	Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)
Effect: 	Illusory sounds
Duration: 	6 sec./level (D)
Saving Throw: 	Will disbelief (if interacted with)
Spell Resistance: 	No

Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises,
recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type
of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter
change the sound’s basic character.  The volume of sound created
depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal
humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking,
singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be
created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any
type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and
squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and
shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans,
while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.
Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell.
Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Silent image:

Casting Time: 	1 standard action
Range: 	Long (400 ft. + 80 ft./level)
Effect: 	Visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)
Duration: 	Concentration
Saving Throw: 	Will disbelief (if interacted with)
Spell Resistance: 	No

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or
force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound,
smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the
limits of the size of the effect.

**** Basic shapeshifting (··)

Alter self: 

Casting Time: 	1 standard action
Range: 	Personal
Target: 	You
Duration: 	10 min./level (D)

You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. 

When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or
held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the
item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you
revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new
form reappear in the same location on your body they previously
occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the
assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and land at
your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body
part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in
the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is
separated from the whole reverts to its true form.

**** Identification (···)

Identify: Identifies an object, revealing its properties.

Alter aura: 

Casting Time: 	1 standard action
Range: 	Touch
Target: 	One touched object weighing up to 5 lb./level
Duration: 	One day/level (D)
Saving Throw: 	None; see text
Spell Resistance: 	No

You alter an item’s aura so that it registers to detect spells (and
spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a
magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you
specify.

If the object bearing magic aura has identify cast on it or is
similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and
detects the object’s actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will
save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals
what the true magic is.

If the targeted item’s own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an
artifact, for instance), magic aura doesn’t work.

**** Basic countermagic (····)

Targeted dispell;
Area dispell;
Minor counterspell

**** Advanced evocation (····)

Fireball

Casting Time: 	1 standard action
Range: 	Long (400 ft. + 80 ft./level)
Area: 	20-ft.-radius spread
Duration: 	Instantaneous
Clash: phy vs 2
Spell Resistance: 	Yes

A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low
roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum
10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take
this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at
which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from
the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or
solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into
the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early
detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage,
such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a
ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and
detonates prematurely.

The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the
area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold,
copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing
barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue
beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the
barrier just as any other spell effect does.  Fireball: all targets in
the area of effect must succeed phy check vs 2 or take 1 damage.  All
creatures in area of effect lose "aggressive".

Rail bolt

Casting Time: 	1 standard action
Range: 	120 ft.
Area: 	120-ft. line
Duration: 	Instantaneous
Saving Throw: phy vs 2
Spell Resistance: 	Yes

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals one damage
to each creature in this area.

The rail bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead,
gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an
interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may
continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise,
it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
